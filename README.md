### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**JPCarvalhinho/Hello- World** is a test place for me to try out git connections.

#0 prepare local machine
- Create local folder in "~/Projects
- Install GIT (sudo apt install as it is a DEB package)
- Install VSCODE (flatpack, don't forget to add the information from Flatpack-Warning to settings.json so you have an operational VSCOde)


#1 Configure GIT user.name
git config -global user.name "Name Surname"

#2 Configure GIT user.email
git config --global user.email "email available in "https://github.com/settings/emails"
